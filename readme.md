# Implementation of the von-Neumann merge sort algorithm

The merge sort algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm which basically consists in the following steps:
- Divide the input list into $n$ sublists of 1 element.
- Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists

Merge sorting algorithm has an average and worst-case scenario performance of $O(n\log (n))$.

We only consider linked-lists.
